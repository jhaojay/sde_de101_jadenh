If I were hired to enable data analytics, I would start by:
1. having a general understanding of the datasets we deal with
2. having a general understanding of the overall business process
3. having a general understand of the current data pipelines
4. gathering info about what kind of analytics do they want to do
5. diving deep into the datasets

I would go about gathering requirements by:
1. asking the stakeholders or project managers to understand what kind of metrics or KPIs do they want to see in their reports.
2. understanding their current state of reporting setup (data source, tools, data quality)
